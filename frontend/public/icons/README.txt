Icon Placeholders for DocuChat AI

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
- favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels)

You can generate these icons using a tool like:
- Favicon Generator: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Icon Kitchen: https://icon.kitchen/

Recommended icon design:
- Use a simple document or chat bubble icon
- Use the primary blue color (#3b82f6) as the main color
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

Once you have created the icons, replace this README.txt file with the actual icon files.
